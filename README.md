# `interfaces`

_Building interfaces since 2021._

`interfaces` is a builder-style user interface library designed to make creation of flexible user interfaces as easy as possible.

Using `interfaces`, an interface can be created by applying a series of transformation operations on a pane. Transformations 
are executed in parallel, and the final result is the 'rendered' pane, ready to be shown to a user.

Interfaces can also be provided arguments during construction, meaning that transformations can apply different operations 
depending on what arguments are provided.

The core idea is: write the definition of an interface once, and reuse it across your code while providing it varying 
arguments.

Let's take the idea of an interface displaying a countdown, from 10 to 0. Instead of creating 10 different instances of the 
UI for each second of the countdown, you can create one Interface, provide it the countdown time as an argument, and have a 
transformation use that argument to show the seconds remaining. If you wanted to have a different coloured background for each 
second, you'd simply add a transformation using the countdown argument that fills the pane with a certain colour. Fun stuff!

## Packages

`interfaces-core` provides the core API classes.

`interfaces-paper` implements `interfaces` using the [Paper Minecraft server API](https://papermc.io). This package provides 
the capability to construct a variety of Minecraft-based interfaces, including text, inventory (i.e. chests), and books.

## Terminology

#### Interface

An interface is the main class that you'll be interacting with. Interfaces hold a series of transformations and other values 
that can be used to construct an InterfaceView.

#### InterfaceView ("view")

An InterfaceView represents a 'rendered' interface. An InterfaceView holds one pane and one InterfaceViewer.

#### InterfaceViewer ("viewer")

An InterfaceViewer represents an object that can view an interface. InterfaceViewers are provided panes to view.

#### Pane

A pane holds a collection of elements that make up the visual aspect of an interface.

#### Transform

A transformation ("transform") operates on a type of pane to add, remove, or change elements. Transformations are used to 
interact with panes.

## Usage

_Gradle instructions coming soon._

## Examples

### Creating an interface with an updating clock.

```java
ChestInterface menuInterface = Interface.chest(4)
        .updating(true) // Sets this interface to updating
        .updateTicks(2) // This interface will now update every 2 ticks
        // Fill the background with bgItem
        .transform(Transform.gridFill(Element.item(
                bgItem,
                (event, view) -> event.setCancelled(true)))
        )
        .transform(Transform.gridItem(Element.item(diamondItem), 1, 1)) // Add an item and x=1 y=1
        // Adds a clock timer (which will update every 2 ticks)
        .transform(Transform.grid((grid, view) -> {
            // Get arguments
            final @NonNull ChestView chestView = (ChestView) view;
            final @NonNull Long time = chestView.arguments().get("time");
            // Add clock element
            grid.element(Element.item(
                    PaperItemBuilder.paper(Material.CLOCK)
                            .name(Component.text("Time: "+time))
                            .build()
            ), 1, 2);
        }))
        .title(Component.text("/menu"));

// Opens the menu with the time argument given.
// Since InterfaceArguments accept a supplier, passing in System::currentTimeMillis will
// provide the latest time every interface update.
menuInterface.open(player, InterfaceArguments.with("time", System::currentTimeMillis));
```
